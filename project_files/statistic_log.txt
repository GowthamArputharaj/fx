After implementing auto close all order in next minute 

1 minute chart

4 charts ( eurusd, usdjpy, euraud, audcad )

-7.80  at [ 19-July-2021 Monday 08:40 am ]

( choosed to let it run until 8:50 am and see what happens.. )
( ofcourse cannot go wild with it because the spread is too low for all the charst in roboforex )

( maybe should try it with 5 minute and 15 minute chart )
( I am also thinking about changing the lot size and making it dynamic with respect the number of confident weight signals )



-8.37 at [ 19-July-2021 Monday 08:50 am ]


AFTER 10 MINUTES LOST ( 0.50 dollar )

ISSUES:
	1 minute chart candle covers less pips ( so the spread is taking higher commission amount for profit )

	In a support / Resistace there may be an oscillation 

After lossing many in 5 minute try 

in 5 minutes we are losing about 2%



1.7761 -> sl
