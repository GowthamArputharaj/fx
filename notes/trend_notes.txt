Trend
	Sideway trend
	Higher trend
	Lower trend

waves have peaks and troughs

Trend based on local minima, local maxima

Steps to find trend line ( not recommended )
	1. Find Local minimas and maximas
		a. Determine a period N

	2. Draw lines between all minimax and maximas

	3. Eleminate non-trendlines
		a. Lines which break trend

	4. Combine similar trend-lines
		a. Based on A: The angle between them and
		b. The points they touch

	5. Rate each trendline by its strength
		a. How many times did the price touch it
		b. Determine D: How far away counts as Touch?

	6. Eliminate weak lines


Find minimas

find line equation
y = mx + b

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

b = y1 - (m * x1)

to find 'b', consider any point of a line ( eg. take a know point of (x1, y1) or (x2, y2))


# To find midpoint of a line
mid_x = (x1 + x2) / 2
mid_y = (y1 + y2) / 2
