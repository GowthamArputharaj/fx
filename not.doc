Chart Reversal
( Hammer, Hanging man)
(source: Steve_Nison-Japanese_Candlestick_Charting_Techniques-EN.pdf)


*	Hammer and Hanging man indicate prior trend should change but not necessarily reverse.

*	An important principle is to place a new position (based on a reversal signal) only if that signal is in the direction of the major trend. 
Let us say, 
for example, that in a bull market, a top reversal pattern appears.
This bearish signal would not warrant a short sale. This is because the
major trend is still up. It would, however, signal a liquidation of longs.
If there was a prevailing downtrend, this same top reversal formation
could be used to place short sales.

*	The longer the lower shadow, 
	the shorter the upper shadow and 
	the smaller the real body the more meaningful the hammer or hanging man. 


*	Although the real body of the hammer or hanging man can be white or black, 
	it is slightly more bullish if the real body of the hammer is white(moved up), and 
	slightly more bearish if the real body of the hanging man is black( moved down)

	-	If a hammer has a white real body 
		it means the market sold off sharply during the session and 
		then bounced back to close at, or near, the session's high.
		This could have bullish ramifications.

	-	If a hanging man has a black real body, 
		it shows that the close could not get back to the opening price level. 
		This could have potentially bearish implications

*	Another Bearish verification
	More the distance between 'body of bullish hammer / bearish hanging man' to 'open position of next candle'
	most likely that next candle will be moving down ( bearish )


*	It was a long, black day with a shaven head and a shaven bottom 
	(that is, it opened on its high and closed on its low). 
	This manifested strong downside momentum.
	(if day before hammer or hanging man is long black candle with shaven bottom and shaven top, less possibility for bullish movement)

Chart Reversal
( Engulfing Pattern )
(source: Steve_Nison-Japanese_Candlestick_Charting_Techniques-EN.pdf)

*	It is multiple candlestick line pattern. with opposite color real bodies.

*	Structure
	- Bearish Engulfing 
		The market must be in a uptrend, 
		then a black real body wraps around, or engulfs, the prior period's white real body.

	- Bullish Engulfing
		The market must be in a downtrend, 
		then a white bullish real body wraps around, or engulfs, the prior period's black real body.
		This shows buying pressure has overwhelmed selling pressure.

*	Criteria
	- The market has to be in a clearly definable uptrend or downtrend, even if the trend is short term.
	- The second real body must engulf the prior real body (it need not engulf the shadows). 
	- The second real body of the engulfing pattern should be the opposite color of the first real body.
	  - Exceptions:
	  	+ The first real body should not be very small like doji
	  	+ After an extended downtrend, 
	  	  	a tiny white real body engulfed by a very large white real body could be a bottom reversal.
	  	+ After an extended uptrend, 
	  		a tiny black real body engulfed by a very large black real body could be a bearish reversal pattern.

*	prior trend, color / engulf type => matters a lot

Chart Reversal ( Top Reversal )
( Dark Cloud Pattern )
(source: Steve_Nison-Japanese_Candlestick_Charting_Techniques-EN.pdf)

*	Two candlestick pattern, top reversal pattern, works in uptrend/top of congestion band.

*	Structure
	- The first day of this two candlestick pattern is a strong white real body.
	- The second day's price opens above the prior session's high 
	  (that is, above the top of the upper shadow) ( prior day high < today open )
	  The second day closes near the low of the day and well within the prior day's white body.
	  Second day should penetrate prior day candle by atleast 50%


*	The greater the degree of penetration into the white real body the more likely a top reversal will occur.

*	Rationale behind the pattern
	- The market is in an uptrend. 
	  A strong white candlestick is followed by a gap higher on the next session's opening. 
	  Thus far, the bulls are in complete control. But then no continuation of the rally occurs!
