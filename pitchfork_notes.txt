Pitchfork Lines / Patterns

Andrew Pitchfork
    According to Alan H. Andrews, there is a high probability of the following:
        Price will reach the latest median line
        Price will either reverse on reaching the median line or gap through it
        When prices pass through the median line, more often than not, prices pull back to the median line
        When price reverses before reaching the median line, it is likely price will move in the opposite direction
        Prices will reverse at any median line

Modified Schiff Pitchfork 
    50% lower / higher than first point ( Tail )


Regular Schiff Pitchfork 
    Tail starts from midpoint of Andrew Pitchfork 

Draw Parallel Lines

base line equation

y = mx + b ( should have values )

find parallel to base line
which crosses at ( xx, yy)

y1 = m1x1 + b 

condition for ||
m = m1 

so 
y1 = m1x1 + b 

yy = m * xx + b 
( find b )



	# data = pd.DataFrame(data)

	# ind = file_data.index

	# data = data.set_index(ind)

	# file_data['extreme'] = data[0]
	
	# data = file_data['extreme']

	# # print(data.iloc[:,0])
	# # print(file_data.head(5), data.head(5))
	# # exit()
